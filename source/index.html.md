# Overview

## Introduction

```

### Welcome to Atomic's developer documentation!

You'll find resources to help you integrate with [Transact](#transact-sdk), our web app that handles the heavy-lifting of integration, as well as a number of [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful API endpoints.

We've tried our best to make this documentation comprehensive and helpful. If you have suggestions or find issues, [please let us know](mailto:engineering@atomicfi.com).

To get going quickly, we recommend using an API collaboration tool called [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com). You can use the button below to import our collection of endpoints. Be sure to set your `apiUrl`, `apiKey`, and `apiSecret` [environment variables](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments-and-globals/manage-environments/).

<div class="postman-run-button"
data-postman-action="collection/import"

<script type="text/javascript">
  (function (p,o,s,t,m,a,n) {
    !p[s] && (p[s] = function () { (p[t] || (p[t] = [])).push(arguments); });
    !o.getElementById(s+t) && o.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild((
      (n = o.createElement("script")),
      (n.id = s+t), (n.async = 1), (n.src = m), n
    ));
  }(window, document, "_pm", "PostmanRunObject", "https://run.pstmn.io/button.js"));
</script>

## Authentication

Atomic uses a combination of API keys and access tokens to authenticate requests.

You can retrieve and manage your API keys in the [Atomic Dashboard](https://dashboard.atomicfi.com/).

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, etc.

## Errors

Our API returns standard HTTP success or error status codes. For errors, we will also include extra information about what went wrong encoded in the response as JSON. The various HTTP status codes we might return are listed below.

| Code | Title                 | Description                     |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    | The request was successful.     |
| 400  | Bad Request           | The request was unacceptable.   |
| 401  | Unauthorized          | Missing or invalid credentials. |
| 404  | Not Found             | The resource does not exist.    |
| 422  | Validation error      | A validation error occurred.    |
| 50X  | Internal Server Error | An error occurred with our API. |

# Products

## Payroll Connect

### Atomic's Payroll Connect products empower users to access and update their payroll data.

When users are authenticating with their payroll account, Atomic requires that the process be facilitated through [Transact](#transact-sdk).

### `deposit`

Update the destination bank account of paychecks

### `verify`

Verify a user’s income and employment status.

### `identify`

Reduce fraud and onboarding friction with verified profile data from a user’s employer.

### Testing

To aid in testing various user experiences, you may use any of these pre-determined "test" credentials for employer authentication. Any password will work, as long as the username is found in this list. When answering MFA questions, any answer will be accepted. If the authentication requires an email, simply append `@test.com` to the end of the chosen username.

| Username                          | Test Case                                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test-good`                       | Test a successful authentication.                                            |
| `test-bad`                        | Test an unsuccessful authentication.                                         |
| `test-failure`                    | Test a failure that occurs after a successful authentication.                |
| `test-distribution-not-supported` | Test a failure that occurs due to an unsupported distribution configuration. |
| `test-code-mfa`                   | Test an authentication that includes a device code based MFA flow.           |
| `test-question-mfa`               | Test an authentication that includes a question-based MFA flow.              |

## Transfer

### Atomic's Transfer products facilitate the movement of assets and liabilities between financial institutions.

### `balance`

Move a user’s credit card or loan balance to a new account.

### Deployment options

#### Transact

[Transact](#transact-sdk) allows the user to easily choose the source of their transfer, while the destination is pre-configured during [Access Token](#create-access-token) creation.

#### Atomic Dashboard

The [Atomic Dashboard](https://dashboard.atomicfi.com/) may be used to initiate a transfer, as well as monitor it's progress as it travels through various states of processing.

#### API

Atomic's API may be used to initiate a transfer by first creating an [Access Token](#create-access-token), and subsequently generating a [Task](#create-task). The status of the task may be monitored through [webhooks](#webhooks) and the [Atomic Dashboard](https://dashboard.atomicfi.com/).

### Testing

When testing `balance`, you may use `4111111111111111` as the origin account number. This will mimic a transfer.

# Transact SDK

![alt text](/source/images/transfer-devices.png "Transact Preview")

### Atomic Transact SDK is a UI designed to securely handle interactions with our products, while performing the heavy-lifting of integration.

## Integration

> Initalize Transact via Javascript

> Sandbox URL

```html
<script src="https://cdn-sandbox.atomicfi.com/transact.js"></script>
```

> Production URL

```html
<script src="https://cdn.atomicfi.com/transact.js"></script>
```

```javascript
const startTransact = () => {
    Atomic.transact({
        // Replace with the server-side generated `publicToken`
        publicToken: "PUBLIC_TOKEN",
        // Could be either 'balance', `verify`, `identify`, or 'deposit'
        product: "balance",
        // Optionally theme Transact
        theme: {
            brandColor: "#FF0000",
            overlayColor: "#000000",
        },
        // Optionally pass in fractional deposit settings
        distribution: {
            // Could be either 'total', 'fixed', or 'percent'
            type: "fixed",
            amount: 50,
            // Could be either 'create', 'update', or 'delete'
            action: "create",
        },
        // Optionally change the language. Could be either 'en' for English or 'es' for Spanish. Default is 'en'.
        language: "en",
        onFinish: function (data) {
            // Called when the user finishes the transaction
            // We recommend saving the `data` object which could be useful for support purposes
        },
        onClose: function () {
            // Called when the user exits Transact prematurely
        },
    });
};

// `startTransact` would typically be user-initiated, such as a button click or tap
startTransact();
```

An [AccessToken](#create-access-token) is required to initialize Transact, and is generated server-side using your API key, and the `publicToken` from the response is returned to your client-side code.

### Mobile & Web

Transact can be initialized by including our JavaScript SDK into your page, and then calling the `Atomic.start` method.

Within the context of a mobile app, we recommend loading Transact into a web view (for example, `WKWebView` on iOS) by building a simple self-hosted wrapper page. The URL used in the webview will be `https://transact.atomicfi.com/initialize/BASE64_ENCODED_STRING`. The `BASE64 Encoded String` is made up of an object containing the parameters used within the SDK (excluding `onFinish` and `onClose`).

> Initialize Transact within a Webview

> Sandbox URL

```html
https://transact-sandbox.atomicfi.com/initialize/BASE64_ENCODED_STRING
```

> Production URL

```html
https://transact.atomicfi.com/initialize/BASE64_ENCODED_STRING
```

```javascript
// Object to be BASE64 Encoded
{
    "publicToken": "PUBLIC_TOKEN",
    "product": "deposit",
    "theme": {
        "brandColor": "#1b1464",
        "overlayColor": "#CCCCCC"
    },
    "distribution": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "amount": 50,
        "action": "create"
    },
    "deeplink": {
        "step": "search-company"
    },
    "language": "en"
}
```

| `language`                        | Optionally pass in a language. Acceptable values: `en` for English and `es` for Spanish. Default value is `en`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `linkedAccount`                   | Optionally pass the `_id` of a [LinkedAccount](#linkedaccount-object). When used, Transact will immediately begin authenticating upon opening. This parameter is used when the [LinkedAccount](#linkedaccount-object)'s `transactRequired` flag is set to `true`.                                                                                  |
| `handoff`                         | Handoff allows views to be handled outside of Transact. In place of the view, corresponding SDK events will be emitted that allows apps to respond and handle these views. Accepts an array. The two string values available are `exit-prompt`, `authentication-success`, and `high-latency`. See [Handoff Pages](#handoff-pages) for more detail. |
| `onFinish`                        | A function that is called when the user finishes the transaction. The function will receive a `data`, which contains the `taskId` object.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `onClose`                         | Called when the user exits Transact prematurely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

#### Handoff Pages

| Page                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exit-prompt`            | If the user has reached the login page and decides to exit, they are prompted with a view that asks them to confirm their exit. When `exit-prompt` is passed into the `handoff` array, users will no longer be presented with the exit confirmation. The `atomic-transact-close` event will be triggered in its place. The event will also send the following data: `{handoff: 'exit-prompt'}` |
| `authentication-success` | When authentication is successful, the user is taken to the success view within Transact. When `authentication-success` is passed into the `handoff` array, users will no longer be taken to the success view. The `atomic-transact-finish` event will be triggered in its place. The event will also send the following data: `{handoff: 'authentication-success'}`                           |
| `high-latency`           | When authentication takes much longer than expected, the user is taken to the the high latency view within Transact. When `high-latency` is passed into the `handoff` array, users will no longer be taken to this view. The `atomic-transact-close` event will be triggered in its place. The event will also send the following data: `{handoff: 'high-latency'}`                            |

## Event Listeners

When using the SDK, events will be emitted and passed to the native application. Such events allow native applications to react and perform functions as needed. Some events will be passed with a data object with additional information.
| Event | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atomic-transact-close` | Triggered in several different instances. <br/><br/> 1. If a user does not find their employer and payroll provider, the data passed with the event will be `{reason: 'zero-search-results'}`. <br/><br/> 2. During the Transact process if a user is prompted to keep waiting or exit and they choose to exit, the data passed with the event will be `{reason: 'task-pending'}`.<br/><br/> 3. At any point if the user clicks on the `x` the data passed with the event will be `{reason: 'unknown'}`|
| `atomic-transact-finish` | Triggered when the user reaches the success screen and closes Transact|
| `atomic-transact-open-url` | Triggered when external links are accessed. The data passed with the event will be `{url: Full URL path}`|
| `atomic-transact-interaction` | Triggered on interactions within Transact. For example, when a user transitions to a news screen or presses the back button. The data passed with the event will be `{name: NAME OF THE EVENT, value: OBJECT CONTAINING EVENT VALUES}`. |

#### Event Interactions

```javascript
{
  name: "EVENT_NAME"
  value: {
    //Default property
    customer: "Atomic",
    //Default property. Possible values are 'en' or 'es'
    language: "en"
    //Default property. Possible values are 'deposit', 'verify', 'identify', or 'balance'
    product: "deposit"
    //Additional properties will be included based on the event that has occurred.
  }
}

```

Each event, by default, will have `customer`, `product`, and `language` in the `value object`. Most events have additional data. See the Additional Properties table below

# Webhooks

### Webhooks are a useful way to receive automated updates, and send timely notification to your user as a transaction progresses.

You can configure webhook endpoints via the [Atomic Dashboard](https://dashboard.atomicfi.com/). Atomic will issue `POST` requests to the designated endpoint(s). We recommend using [Request Bin](https://requestbin.com/) as a way to inspect the payload of events during development without needing to stand up a server.

## Securing webhooks

To validate a webhook request came from Atomic, we suggest verifying the payloads with the `X-HMAC-Signature-Sha-256` header (which we pass with every request).

| Header                     | Description                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `X-HMAC-Signature-Sha-256` | A SHA1 HMAC hexdigest computed with your API secret and the raw body of the request. |

## Event types

This is a list of all the types of events we currently send. We may add more at any time, so you shouldn't rely on only these types existing in your code.

Each event object includes a `data` property which contains unique data points for each type of event. Each event type below describes these unique data points.

## Task status updated

> Request body example

```json
{
    "product": "verify",
    "linkedAccount": "5d77f9e1070856f3828945c6"
}
```

To generate a task using a Linked Account, a `Task` request is created that contains the `product` and the `_id` of the [LinkedAccount](#linkedaccount-object). A `Task` is then created if the request is successful.

### HTTP Request

`POST /task/create`

### Authentication headers

| Name           | Description                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `x-api-key`    | API Key for your Atomic account    |
| `x-api-secret` | API Secret for your Atomic account |

### Request properties

| Name                              | Type   | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `product` <h6>required</h6>       | string | One of `verify`, `identify`, or `deposit`.                                                      |
| `linkedAccount` <h6>required</h6> | string | The `_id` of a [LinkedAccount](#linked-account-object) object.                                  |
| `distribution`                    | object | The distribution of the deposit as defined in the [SDK parameters](#javascript-sdk-parameters). |

### Response

> Example responses

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": "5d3b23b155f500465c895f60",
        "status": "queued"
    }
}
```

Successfully creating a `Task` will return a payload with a `data` object containing both a public `_id_` and a private `status` of `queued`. The `status` will change as the task progresses towards completion. The [Atomic Dashboard](https://dashboard.atomicfi.com/) can be used to track task progress. If you plan on implementing [webhooks](#webhooks), we recommend saving the task `_id` for reference.

### Response Properties

| Name     | Type   | Description                                   |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `_id`    | string | Unique identifier for the `Task`.             |
| `status` | string | [Status](#task-status-updated) of the `Task`. |
